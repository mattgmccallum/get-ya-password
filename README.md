# Description
Password security is essential to living a in a safe and secure online world. Randomly generated passwords are the most secure way of keeping your data safe. With randomly generated passwords users are less likely to re-use old password for multiple sites thus curbing th effects that data-leaks will have on their security.

This site allows users to randomly generate a password based on certain selectable criteria; uppercase only, lowercase only, numbers only, special characters only, or a combination of any!

# Changes
The HTML file has had new code added to include checkboxes that give the functionality to inlcude or exclude characters from the password

The CSS file has had a line of code added to remove dot points on the checkbox list.

The JavaScript file has been rewritten to allow random passwords to be generated in a text box based on certain critetria.
